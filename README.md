### So What is Realm ? ü§î
The Realm is an object and mobile database. It‚Äôs a data-storage solution for mobile and web development. A simpler definition would be that the Realm is where your app‚Äôs or website‚Äôs data is stored and managed. One could say that the Realm mobile database is the perfect replacement for SQLite and Core Data.

Realm offers a database solution for development languages Java, Kotlin, Swift, Obj-C, JavaScript, and .NET. You can use the Swift Package Manager (SPM), CocoaPods, or Carthage to add Realm to your development project. We found that SPM is the quickest and easiest way to get started.
